- Provide insights to pandemic policy in order to improve the effectiveness of intervention.
- Provide insights to how demographic, culture, and circumstances (employed vs. unemployed) might affect people behavior during pandemic.
# Books
1. [Fundamental Numerical Methods and Data Analysis](https://ads.harvard.edu/books/1990fnmd.book/) <br/>

   **Author Information:** George W. Collins, II<br/>
   
   **Published By:** Havard University Press<br/>
   
   This book is interesting because it introduces basic numerical analysis. From then, it builds up topics that are instrumental in data analysis. In addition, the book also provides practice questions.
